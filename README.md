## What is Typebot?
Typebot is an open-source alternative to Landbot. It allows you to create conversational apps/forms (Lead qualification, Product launch, User onboarding, Customer support), embed them anywhere on your web/mobile apps, and collect results in real-time.

The best way to understand the basic principles of Typebot is by watching the "Get started" video series:
